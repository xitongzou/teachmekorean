[aniyo] = No. But in Korean, when people say '네', it is not the same as saying 'Yes.' in English. The same goes for '아니요' too. This is because the Korean '네' expresses your 'agreement' to what the other person said. And '아니요' expresses your 'disagreement' or 'denial' to what the other person said."

[ne, ma-ja-yo] = Yes, that’s right. This is in order to express more strongly and clearly that you are saying 'You’re right.' rather than sounding like you are just passively listening, while nodding."

Suppose someone said something to you but you couldn’t hear the person well or you weren’t paying much attention. Then you can say '네?' [ne?] to mean 'Pardon me?' 'I’m sorry?' 'What did you say?' 'I didn’t hear you well.' You can also use '네?' to show your surprise."
